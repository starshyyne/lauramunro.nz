    In my role as a service designer at Te Tari Pūreke, the Firearms Safety Authority, I spearheaded the redesign and development of the organization's public-facing website on the Drupal platform. Our goal was to create a seamless experience that prioritized user engagement and accessibility.     
    To achieve this, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of user feedback, industry trends, and web design best practices. Collaborating closely with content designers, we identified the need for modular sections to simplify the presentation of complex regulatory information. I crafted custom sections featuring rich text editors, embedded videos, and accordion elements, allowing for flexible content presentation across the site. 
    A primary focus of the project was to ensure responsiveness and accessibility across various devices, achieved through a mobile-first design and development approach. As a result, the website offers a user-friendly experience on desktops, tablets, and smartphones. 
    The redesigned website has received overwhelmingly positive feedback from stakeholders and users alike. With extensive content enhancements led by the digital advisory team, it has become the go-to resource for firearms regulatory information, catering to both the public and staff members.
