I’ve recently heard this word spoken of a lot, especially in relation to the COVID pandemic and the current economic climate. Usually it’s regarded as a highly positive ability to adapt to sudden challenges. I’d like to unpack it a bit and look at how resilience can be distorted into an unhealthy long term strategy that leads to burn out, and some alternatives.

## Individual response to community cause 
Usually we talk about being resilient when something challenging happens with no or little warning. These sudden challenges are usually caused by some external factor completely outside the control of the individual. Say the COVID pandemic. Individuals have been asked to show resilience to a global event. But we’ve seen very little global response to a global situation - it’s been reliant on individual governments to put protections in place for individual citizens. In those sorts of situations individual resilience is only going to take you so far, if the wider community is against you. Research shows mask wearing is much more beneficial when those who have been exposed wear a mask, but the responsibility has shifted to the individual potentially being exposed. Demonstrating resilience by continuing to wear a mask regardless of the context, while somewhat beneficial to the individual, has less of an impact than community wide changes such as enforcing mask usage in high risk situations. 

## Shifting blame 

While individuals demonstrating resilience is a powerful tool to mitigate the impact of unfortunate external factors, valuing resilience over all else can also be used as a way to shift blame and impact. It’s easier for people to praise individuals showing enourmous resilience than work to address the systemic inequalities that led to them needing to show resilience in the first place. 

A good example of this is in the workplace, when a business decides to drastically shift priorities. Teams are asked to be resilient, and go with the flow. This disproportionately disadvantages those who struggle with change and need clear priorities, such as those who are autistic or who have ADHD. Reducing systemic inequalities in these situations would be for businesses to take steps to reduce the impact of change on teams, for clear and consistent communication, and providing a chance to feedback on the changes. There is nearly always something that can be done to reduce the need for people to be resilient. 

## Toxic positivity 

I also see a risk in regarding resilience over all else, in that it can encourage a culture of toxic positivity. It can see resilience as the goal and end state, rather than a tool for coping with uncontrollable situations. The goal should be reducing the need to practice resilience, by building strong communities that value everyone’s different needs. Toxic positivity exists when people aren’t empowered to speak up and be vulnerable in sharing what’s not working for them. When everyone’s voice is valued, including their criticism, we make space to improve things. 

Humans have evolved to have emotions, they protect us and tell us when something’s wrong. When being resilient is distorted into bottling up healthy and natural emotions, it’s not healthy or productive. Enduring situations that call for resilience for long periods of time will eventually lead to burn out. It leaves people less able to cope with situations that really call for resilience - like the sudden death of a loved one. 

## Take aways

Resilience comes about when people experience sudden challenging situations. It also happens when people are faced with trauma and systemic inequalities that shouldn’t exist in the first place. When asking people to be resilient, should you really be asking another question? What impacts is this going to have for you? How are you feeling about this? What can I do to make this easier for you? What barriers are stopping you from being able to adapt to this change? With some patience and collective effort, the need to be resilient can be greatly reduced and saved for those times it’s desperately needed.
