As more governments are adopting the WCAG as part of their policies for digital content, it’s becoming more important for designers to understand what this means, and how to build it into their products. The good news is, an accessible website is good for everybody, not just those with disabilities.

Accessibility is something that ideally, is considered from the inception of a digital product. While it is possible and definitely worthwhile to retroactively adopt websites and apps to be more accessible, it is much more difficult and will require extensive rework for both the design and development.

There are some simple practicle steps you can take to get started. The main branches of accessible websites are that they are Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust. For designers, it is a little more subjective than developers, and today we’re going to look at two of the areas that apply more to designers, making websites Perceivable and Understandable.

## Perceivability

“Make it easier for users to see and hear content.”  

Designers can contribute to creating a digital experience more perceivable right from the get go. In practical terms, a lot of this comes down to user interface design. 

### Make font sizes larger

It can be tempting to put secondary text such as a date or order numbers in a smaller size than the text around it. It’s also tempting to reduce font size in order to fit more information on a page. This can make it difficult for those with vision difficulties, those with reduced sight but not blind, to use the website. A user may zoom in on a page to read small information, which may make it difficult for them to complete their task if the page elements don’t resize well. For this I like to suggest the squint test. Look at a design and squint your eyes so everything goes a little blurry, and increase the font size until it’s ledgible.

### Check colours for contrast 

In the same vein, if the colours of text or a graphic element do not have enough contrast with their backgrounds, it will be difficult for people to see and understand easily. As well as those with vision difficulties, this is also important for people who are colourblind, which is thought to be as high as 1 in 12 men, and 1 in 200 in women. Good news everybody, WebAIM has a great handy tool for this. Simply put in the hex codes of the colours you’re using and it will show you the contrast values. If the contrast isn’t high enough, there’s not a lot your user can do to try to fix it, or they may not even know there’s something there they can’t see. 

### Don’t rely on icons for meaning

Ever had the problem where you’re on a new website, and trying to find your way around, but nothing has a label? This creates problems for everybody, not just those with visual impairments. Depending on where you’re from, or how old you are, a symbol that denotes one thing for one person may denote something completely different for someone else. Icons should have corresponding labels. It’s also highly suggested to use a useful hover label to further explain the action that will happen when the icon is clicked or tapped. 

### Have clear page text hierarchy 

Web content should have a clear top heading element, usually a page title. Other headings should each decrease in font size, and be easily distinguishable from regular page text. Headings should be consistent across different pages, so users can easily identify the headings and subheadings, and don’t have to re-learn a new pattern on each page. Don’t be afraid to have a decent amount of breathing room between text elements, this will help people with reading difficulties be able to take in your content. 

## Understandable

“Make text readable and understandable.”  
“Make content appear and operate in predictable ways.”  
“Help users avoid and correct mistakes.”  

This is where user experience and user interface design cross paths. These aspects of accessibility relate more to how the user interprets what a website is trying to say or asking them to do. Having a website that is easy to understand helps people with learning and reading difficulties like dyslexia, as well as those for which English is a second language. 

### Write in plain terms

Not every team has dedicated content and copywriters, and it’s often left up to the designer to write copy. Avoid using jargon, and when introducing a term or acronym for the first time, explain what it means. Most often I’ve seen this on menus, where a normal label is replaced with something more fancy or on-brand.

#### Not helpful:

- Emporium
- Our Specialities
- Pantry

#### Helpful:

- Store
- Shop

While it might be on brand, if someone can’t find your store, they can’t buy what you’re selling. When in doubt, remember the age-old design principle, Keep It Simple Stupid (KISS). 

### Be up front with field requirements

Ever tried to create a password for a website, only to be given an error message, which changes on each attempt? It can be a frustrating experience. This comes down to helping users avoid mistakes. If the design up front lets the user know what the password requirements are, they can avoid triggering the error message at all. Relying on error messaging to convey requirements is a dark pattern that should be avoided. In user experience design we are often trying to limit the information shown to the user to help make their experience easy, but if we aren’t giving them enough information to succeed on their first try, it isn’t enough information. 

#### Not helpful:

- Choose a password
- Make it a strong one

#### Helpful:

- Choose a password
- Must have upper and lowercase characters, and a number or symbol

Have specific and helpful error messaging 
If a website needs to show an error, it should guide the user to understand exactly what it is they need to do to correct the problem. Don’t rely on colour alone to signify an error state, if someone is colour blind it may not look any different to them. It’s best to have a short message that is phrased as how to solve the problem. 

#### Not helpful:

- Incorrect date


#### Helpful:

- Date must be before today

## In Summary 

Web accessibility for designers is a lot more subjective than the technical requirements for developers, but that doesn’t make it less worthwhile or valuable. Making a website more perceivable and understandable is good for all users, and can have a measurable impact on your bottom line as well. Having an understanding of what types of things to consider when it comes to improving accessibility is half the battle, otherwise we don’t know what we don’t know.
